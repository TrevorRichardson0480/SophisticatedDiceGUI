# SophisticatedDiceGUI
Finishing up some java topics and really wanted to try out JavaFX. I tried to use the most JavaFX components I could for this little project. Hence why I call it "sophisticated". Its a dice rolling program, with quirks and features. Right now it uses one die but may use more in the future.
